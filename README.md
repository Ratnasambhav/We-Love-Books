# We-Love-Books
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) clone made usning NodeJS, Express and MongoDB when I was learning NodeJS.
Frontend is done using Pug and Sass.
It takes data from the [Goodread api](https://www.goodreads.com/api) and hence we can browse books from a huge database.
The project is still incomplete. Feel free to add/imporve on the existing code and send a pull request.

## Features
* User login
* Book search by title
* Book search by author
* Created collections/list of books
* Add tags to books
* Read/unread books
* Maybe more....
